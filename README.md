## Overview

This project is a Java-based Linked List implementation with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It allows users to perform operations like inserting nodes at the beginning or end of the list, deleting nodes, and displaying the current state of the linked list. The project was developed by Celajes, Jimenez, and Soriano as part of a final requirement for the **Computer Science** course.

## Features

- **Insert at Beginning**: Adds a new node with user-inputted data at the beginning of the linked list.
- **Insert at End**: Appends a new node with user-inputted data at the end of the linked list.
- **Delete Node**: Removes a node with the specified data from the linked list.
- **Display Linked List**: Displays the current structure of the linked list in the GUI.

## How to Run the Application
1. Download the `.jar` file from this repository.
2. Double-click the `.jar` file to run the program.

### Troubleshooting
- If the `.jar` file does not run, it may be due to an issue with your system's `.jar` file association. To fix this, download and run [Jarfix](https://johann.loefflmann.net/en/software/jarfix/index.html) developed by Johann N. LÃ¶fflmann. This will re-associate `.jar` files with the Java Runtime Environment on your device.
- Ensure you have the latest version of [Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](https://www.java.com/) installed.
